# hello-world
A location to discuss and share ideas.

My name is Trevor Fisher, and I am a chemical engineering major and computer science minor. I plan on heading to graduate school to earn a PhD in chemical engineering. I want to get into the nanomaterials and surfactants field, and the ability to write code will without a doubt be essential in pursuing this field.
